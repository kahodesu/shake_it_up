This is a game Ramsey and I made for Digital Day Camp 2013. 
It was orginally made in unity and flora. and I am attempting to make a processing and arduino uno version. 

problems: I am not sure why the win and lose state images don't come up at the end. 
I tried many things. 
The sounds play but the images don't show.
